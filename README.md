Book Management and Web Service

This project consists of two services:

Management Service: Handles the core backend logic for managing books.
Web Service: Provides a user interface and interacts with the Management Service API.

Prerequisites
To run the services via the compiled JAR files, ensure the following requirements are met:

System Requirements
Java 17: Required to run the JAR files.
Maven: (Optional) Needed only if you want to build the project yourself from source.

Installing Java 17
Windows:
  Download the JDK installer from Oracle or AdoptOpenJDK.
  Install and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

Linux/Mac:
  Use your package manager to install Java 17 
Verify installation:
  java -version

*How to Run the Project*
Step 1: Run the Management Service
  Navigate to the directory containing the Management Service JAR file and open command line there then type in the below command to start the service.
  java -jar Book-Management-Service.jar
Verify the service is running:
Open a browser and visit: http://localhost:8080/books/getAllBooks.
You should see two dummy books preloaded in the system:


Step 2: Run the Web Service
  Navigate to the directory containing the Web Service JAR file and open command line there then type in the below command to start the service.
  Start the service:
  java -jar Book-Web-Service.jar

Access the web interface:
Open a browser and visit: http://localhost:8081/books.


*How to Use the Services*
1. Web Service
This service provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the Book Management System.

Available Actions
View All Books: Visit http://localhost:8081/books to see a list of all books.
Add a New Book: Click on the "Add New Book" button or visit http://localhost:8081/books/add.
Edit a Book: Use the "Edit" button next to a book in the list.
Delete a Book: Use the "Delete" button next to a book in the list.


2. Management Service API
The Web Service communicates with the Management Service API. Advanced users can directly interact with the API:

List All Books: GET http://localhost:8080/books/getAllBooks
Add a Book: POST http://localhost:8080/books/addBook
Edit a Book: PUT http://localhost:8080/books/updateBook/{id}
Delete a Book: DELETE http://localhost:8080/books/deleteBook/{id}
Note: All Web Service operations depend on the Management Service being active.

Key Notes
Inter-Service Communication: The Web Service interacts with the Management Service via RESTful APIs. Ensure the Management Service is started before launching the Web Service.

URL Structure:
  Management Service: http://localhost:8080
  Web Service: http://localhost:8081

Testing:
Both Unit Tests and Integration Tests have been carried out for the Book Management Service to ensure functionality and reliability.

Key Actions for Seamless Use
Ensure Proper Order: Start the Management Service before the Web Service to avoid errors.
Browser Interactions: Use http://localhost:8081/books as the entry point for all interactions.
API Access:
If debugging is needed, use tools like Postman to interact directly with the Management Service API.
